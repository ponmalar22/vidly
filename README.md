rendering a table using ReactJS

In this project I am using a fakeMovieServices file as a imaginary database. 
We are using a table to display movies in DB with a Delete button to delete the movies in DB, 
and also displaying a message on the top of the table to display the number of movies in DB

Code inspired from codewith mosh react course.
